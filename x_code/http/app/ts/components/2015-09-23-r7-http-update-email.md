**Hey everyone!**

It's here! The long-awaited chapter on Angular 2's HTTP library!

In this chapter we cover how to create an awesome YouTube search-as-you-type app. 

Here's a screenshot of me searching YouTube for "cats playing ipads":

We've included the full source-code to this app, along with a few other examples of HTTP requests.

Did I mention that this brings the book to **OVER 200 PAGES**? Well it brings the book to 218 pages, to be exact. 

**To get the update, either:**

* If you created a Gumroad account when you bought the book, head to your Gumroad account and [navigate to your Gumroad library to view files](https://gumroad.com/library) or
* Find your original purchase confirmation email and click on the big green "View Product" button.
* [Buy the book](https://ng-book.com/2) if you haven't already

**What's next**

Everyone is asking: How can I update my Angular 1 app to Angular 2, piece by piece? The core team has some great implementations on the way that will let Angular 1 and Angular 2 live side-by-side. 

We're working on a step-by-step guide on how to convert your Angular 1 app to Angular 2. 

Also we've got a chapter on the new Angular Router on the way! 

Talk soon!
